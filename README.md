Title: Pokémon Ketupat Adventure

Plot:
In the region of Nusantara, a mystical land inspired by the diverse landscapes of Malaysia, ancient legends speak of powerful Pokémon guardians protecting the balance of nature. However, an evil organization known as Team Bunga Raya threatens to disrupt this harmony by exploiting the power of legendary Pokémon for their own selfish gain.

As a young trainer from the village of Ketupat, it's your destiny to embark on a journey to stop Team Bunga Raya and restore peace to the region. Along the way, you'll encounter various Pokémon inspired by Malaysian flora and fauna, as well as challenges that will test your skills as a trainer and your understanding of data structures.

Gameplay Features:

    Malaysian-inspired Pokémon: Design Pokémon based on creatures from Malaysian mythology, such as the legendary Garuda or the mischievous Orang Bunian. Each Pokémon could have unique abilities and typings influenced by Malaysian culture.

    Data Structure Challenges: Integrate puzzles and challenges that require players to use data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues to progress through the game. For example, solving puzzles in ancient temples or navigating through dense jungles using graph traversal algorithms.

    Regional Variation: Explore different terrains and climates within the Nusantara region, each with its own set of Pokémon species and environmental challenges. From the lush rainforests of Borneo to the towering peaks of Mount Kinabalu, there's always something new to discover.

    Team Customization: Allow players to customize their team with Pokémon they've captured along their journey. Implement a storage system using data structures like hash tables or trees to manage the player's Pokémon collection.

    Mini-Games: Include mini-games that challenge players to optimize their Pokémon team using data structures. For example, a breeding mini-game that requires players to select compatible Pokémon pairs based on their types and traits.

By combining Pokémon gameplay with elements of Malaysian culture and data structure challenges, Pokémon Ketupat Adventure could provide an engaging and educational experience for players of all ages. Good luck with your project!
